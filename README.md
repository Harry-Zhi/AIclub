AI club summary

So we had our first AI club meeting last week. We discussed the following paper:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07122

which proposes a new form of convolutional networks to reduce the number of parameters and improving accuracy.
The Github link is here:https://github.com/fyu/dilation

In addition, Dilated Convolution is now available in Keras: https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/#atrousconv2d
under: AtrousConvolution
