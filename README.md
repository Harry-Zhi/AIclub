# AI club summary

### First meeting, 10/12, MA

We discussed the following paper:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07122

which proposes a new form of convolutional networks to reduce the number of parameters and improving accuracy.
The Github link is here:https://github.com/fyu/dilation

In addition, Dilated Convolution is now available in Keras: https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/#atrousconv2d
under: AtrousConvolution

### Second meeting, 10/20, SD

I would like to talk about the work Facebook has been doing on Unsupervised edge generation
https://www.facebook.com/atscaleevents/videos/1682914828648281/
3D ConvNets , Unsupervised Edge generation using Optical Flow as a ground truth and then iterating to reinforce
 
Here is the paper that goes with the above Video
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04166

Interesting points in this talk: using edge detection for pre-training, 3D convolutions for processing sequences of images(videos) for  different applications such as video classification and captioning, optical flow analysis



### Third meeting, 10/28, TY

Object segmentation from pump images. 

Interesting points: using different labels for each piece, using other objective functions such as binary_cross_entropy, using other image resolutions.
