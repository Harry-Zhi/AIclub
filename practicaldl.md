## Introduction
There are different ways of explaining how and why deep learning works. From mimicing the brain function to hierarchical feature extractors. I would like to think that deep learning networks are function estimators. In this view, we try to estimate as good as possible. But what are the functions? Imagine we need to design a system to tranlate language X to language Y. Then, the function would be a good translator. We want to find a object Y in an image X. The function is an object detector, and so forth. In any case, we have an input X and want an output Y=f(X). The question is how do you want to design such a function to perform these tasks!
