### Stanford Deep Learning School

The talks at the Deep Learning School on September 24/25, 2016 were amazing. I clipped out individual talks from the full live streams and provided links to each below in case that's useful for people who want to watch specific talks several times (like I do). Please check out the official website (http://www.bayareadlschool.org) and full live streams below.

Having read, watched, and presented deep learning material over the past few years, I have to say that this is one of the best collection of introductory deep learning talks I've yet encountered. Here are links to the individual talks and the full live streams for the two days:

1. [Foundations of Deep Learning (Hugo Larochelle, Twitter] - (https://youtu.be/zij_FTbJHsk)
