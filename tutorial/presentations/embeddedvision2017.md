  - [MAV group](https://pixhawk.ethz.ch/)
  - 3D reconstruction on mobile (ostrivis, GPU)
  - visual odometry, head tacking, 4 cameras and IMV
  - Surface reconstruction
  - spacial mapping
  - deckless workers: merge real and digital world
  - 3D designers and decison makers, learners
  - hololens for [medical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKpKlh1-en0)
  - opportunities: ego centric vision, overlay results directly on 3D world
  
- Cormac Brick, Movidius
  - battle between traditional algorithms and deep learning
  - classical CV: HOG, ORB, SVM
  - DL: CNN, RNN, RL, GAN
  - 2014 (Yan Lecun talk), Today(image, speech, transfer learning), 2020
  - Surveilance
  - SLAM (feature based)
  - ship in 2017: SLAM: classical
  - 3 key ingeredients: data, algorithms, compute per $
- The coming shift from image sensors to image sensing
- emotion recognition from images in the wild
- implementing the tensorflow deep learning framework on qualcomm low-power dsp
- Deep learning beyond cats and cars: Alex LUXOFT
  - data acqusition, data pipeline, training and development
  - shift in SW R&D
  - data is king
  - data coverage all cases
  - data balance, all classes
  - amount of data
  - custom shiffling: 1.3%
  - data imbalance
  - pure DL : not practical
  - simple model, simple data
  - Alexnet is usally enough
  - mAP, precision, Recall at IOU=0.5!!! could be optimized
 - collaboratively benchmarking and optimizing deep learning: collective knowlege on github, ck caffe
 - DL and vision in MATLAB: c++ caffe, MATLAB to CUDA compiler, DL on MATLAB, fixed-point support
 - Enabling the full potential of machine learning
 - how to start an embedded vision company
