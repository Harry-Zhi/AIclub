### Training Deep Learning Networks, tips and tricks



* important hyper-parameters: learning rate, batch size, number of filters, depth
* network converges to all zero output
  - try smaller learning rates
  - try different random seed point to have different weights initialization
  - initialize with pre-trained weights from similar applications
  - try different data shuffling
  - for segmentation applications, try both with and without skip connections
    
  * imbalanced data classification
    - use stratify data split
