### Install Docker on HP laptop
Docker for windows requires Windows 10 pro. On my HP laptop Windows 10 Home edition is installed.
As such, instead we need to install Docker toolbox. To install Docker toolbox, first we need to make sure
that Virtualization is enabaled in: Task Manager-> Performance -> CPU -> Virtualization Enabled
If it is disabled, we need to go to: Bios -> Processor and enable Virtualization
Next, we can install Docker Toolbox.
